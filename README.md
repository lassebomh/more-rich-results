This extension adds Stack Overflow and Reddit previews to the Google search page (among others).

## Features

### Result Previews
 - Reddit [(example)](https://i.imgur.com/bjUt4JF.png) 
 - Stack Exchange (Stack Overflow, Server Fault, Ask Ubuntu, ...) [(example)](https://i.imgur.com/DmNlz5a.png)

### Supported search engines
 - Google
 - DuckDuckGo
 - Startpage
 - Searx (experimental - only works on searx.tiekoetter.com)
 
### Other features
 - Expandable comments in Reddit
 - Comments in Reddit are hidden/displayed based on its upvotes compared to the post (simplification).
 - The main content of Stack Exchange questions are hidden by default, because it's often skipped (but there is a unhide button).

## Features in consideration
 - Remove `$` from bash snippets
 - Add button to run JS code
 - Add copy button to code snippets
 - Settings page to toggle features
 
 Suggestions are welcome!
