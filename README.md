This extension adds more types of rich results to Google and other search engines.

#### New rich results:
 1. Stack Exchange (Stack Overflow, Server Fault, Super User, Ask Ubuntu and so on...)
 2. Reddit

#### Supported search engines:
 1. Google (w/ NoScript version)
 2. DuckDuckGo (w/ NoScript version)

#### Other features:
 - Plenty of graphical improvements to Googles NoScript version. This version can be accessed if JavaScript is turned off (not including the extension) and a Google search is made. You can tell that you are running the NoScript by looking for `gbv=1` in the URL parameters. 
 - Removed redirects on both DDG and Google's NoScript versions, so all links are direct.

#### Planned features:
 - Searx support
 - Rotten Tomatoes results
 - Quora results
 - GitHub repos & issues
 - Better schema highlighting (q&a pages and faq pages)
